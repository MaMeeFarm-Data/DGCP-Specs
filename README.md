# 🦆 DGCP-specs — Canonical Protocol Specifications

This repository contains the **official, canonical specifications** for the  
**Duck Governance & Continuous Proof™ (DGCP™)** protocol.

DGCP is a **Human-Proof Protocol**, designed to protect Real-Work Proof (RWD)  
created by workers using the smallest possible technology stack:

> **Phone → Metadata → IPFS CID → GitHub SHA256 → Minimal DLT Timestamp (OTS/Bitcoin)**

No IoT sensors, biometric systems, machine-learning scoring, or proprietary infrastructure are required.  
DGCP scales through **humans**, not machines.

---

## 🌱 Mission

To establish a global, open, decentralized standard that ensures:

- **Human-origin authenticity** of every Proof  
- **Cryptographic integrity** using open tools  
- **Privacy-preserving metadata** (no GPS, no PII)  
- **Global auditability** through a public registry  
- **Fairness for workers** in the age of AI and data exploitation  

DGCP is built for low-income environments and real-world labor conditions.

## 🧩 Foundational Principles

### **1. DGCP is a Human-Proof Protocol, not a Data-Collection Protocol.**
- No sensors  
- No automated surveillance  
- No biometric requirements  
- No machine-generated labor inputs  
- No ML scoring or classification  

DGCP respects the worker as the only legitimate origin of Proof.

### **2. Machine Validation must never override Human Interpretation.**
- Machine-Critical fields ensure **technical integrity**  
- Human-Interpretive fields ensure **truth and meaning**  
- Final judgment remains under **Human Governance**, not AI  

This separation creates an ethical, resilient model that scales globally.

## 🔗 Minimal Proof Chain

DGCP uses a deliberately minimal chain:

1. **Phone**  
   - Worker captures the real moment of labor  
2. **Metadata**  
   - DMS v1.0.0 defines the minimum fields for Proof integrity  
3. **IPFS CID**  
   - Immutable content addressing  
4. **GitHub SHA256 Registry**  
   - Public, append-only provenance  
5. **Minimal DLT Timestamp**  
   - Global auditability anchor (OTS/Bitcoin)  

This allows DGCP to run even in low-income, low-infrastructure communities.

## 📘 Current Standard: DMS v1.0.0

- Human-Readable Spec: `DMS_SPEC.md`
- Machine Schema: `schema/dms-v1.0.0.json`

Future versions will remain backward-compatible,  
preserving all prior Real-Work Proofs permanently.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

DGCP aims to become a global ethical standard for:

- Real-Work Proof (RWD)  
- Labor transparency  
- Fair data rights  
- Ethical AI training  
- Agricultural & rural verification  
- Public policy, banking, and development audit trails  

DGCP is not a corporation.  
DGCP is **a protocol for humanity**.

## 🦆 Maintained by MaMeeFarm™

MaMeeFarm™ pioneered the DGCP protocol through real, daily, verifiable work  
originating from Lampang, Thailand — establishing the world’s first  
Real-Work Data System (RWD) built entirely on human labor.
