# 🦆 DGCP™ Real-Work Proof (RWP) — Definition v1.0.0  
### Canonical Definition of Human-Origin, Meaningful Labor in DGCP

This document defines what qualifies as a **Real-Work Proof (RWP)**  
within the DGCP protocol.  
It is the philosophical and operational foundation for all DMS metadata,  
Validator actions, Indexing Layers, and Federated Human Audit (FHA) decisions.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Real-Work Proof Definition

The RWP definition exists to:

1. Protect the meaning of human labor  
2. Prevent machine-generated or AI-generated work from entering DGCP  
3. Provide a global, neutral standard usable in any country  
4. Allow FHA auditors to evaluate proof consistently  
5. Make DGCP scalable without losing human-origin authenticity

# 2. The Three Pillars of Real-Work Proof (RWP)

An activity qualifies as Real-Work Proof **only if** it satisfies all three pillars:

---

## Pillar 1 — **Human-Origin Action**  
The work must be performed by a human body or human decision.

Examples:
- Feeding ducks  
- Fixing water pumps manually  
- Collecting eggs  
- Walking 3 km to buy food  
- Writing DGCP governance specs  
- Checking animals, cleaning shelters  
- Harvesting crops with manual effort  

Non-examples:
- IoT devices automatically logging temperature  
- A drone scanning a field  
- Automated harvesting machines  
- AI generating proof descriptions  

If a machine replaces human effort → It is NOT RWP.

---

## Pillar 2 — **Meaningful Contribution to Survival or System Function**  
The work must meaningfully contribute to:

- survival  
- farm operation  
- household continuity  
- system improvement  
- environmental upkeep  
- DGCP governance or documentation  

Examples:
- Preparing food in poverty conditions  
- Maintaining solar lights because there is no electricity  
- Pumping water manually  
- Recording daily RWD logs  
- Writing FHA policies  
- Cleaning animal areas to reduce disease risk  

Non-examples:
- Taking a random selfie  
- Symbolic or staged actions that don’t contribute  
- Repeating tasks solely to produce “more data” for DGCP  

DGCP rejects “data farming” behavior.

---

## Pillar 3 — **Observable Evidence + Human Description**
Every RWP must include:

1. **Observable artifact**  
   (photo or short video stored via IPFS CID)  
2. **Human-written description**  
   (short_human_description in DMS)

The description MUST:

- Be written by a human  
- Use honest, real-world language  
- Reflect the action performed  
- Contain no AI-generated long text  

The media MUST reflect reality without staging.

---

# 3. Categories of Real-Work in DGCP

RWP falls into five universal categories:

1. **Agricultural Labor**  
   – duck care, egg collection, feeding animals, field work  

2. **Household Survival Labor**  
   – cooking with limited resources, gathering water  

3. **Maintenance & Repair**  
   – fixing structures, tools, pumps, solar lights  

4. **Environmental Stewardship**  
   – cleaning, clearing land, safety checks  

5. **Cognitive/System Labor (DGCP-specific)**  
   – writing governance documents  
   – designing metadata standards  
   – indexing registry data  
   – reviewing proofs in FHA  

DGCP recognizes intellectual labor as real labor *when it directly contributes to DGCP system stability.*

# 4. Activities That Do NOT Qualify as Real-Work Proof

To protect integrity, the following **NEVER qualify**:

### 4.1 Machine-Generated Work  
- IoT sensors  
- drones  
- AI image generation  
- automated farm equipment  

### 4.2 Passive Observation  
- “I stood and watched the ducks”  
- photo without meaningful action  

### 4.3 Surveillance-Type Actions  
- CCTV footage  
- hidden cameras  
- facial recognition logs  

### 4.4 Staged or Fake Proof  
- repeating tasks just for content  
- creating fake situations  
- copying old photos  

### 4.5 Excessive AI Assistance  
- AI-written descriptions  
- AI-enhanced media  

DGCP = **Human truth, not synthetic content.**

---

# 5. Minimum Requirements for RWP Submission

A valid RWP must include:

1. **Human-performed action**  
2. **Human-written description**  
3. **Primary IPFS CID**  
4. **Coarse location label**  
5. **Timestamp (UTC)**  
6. **Signature using worker_id_public**  
7. **DMS structure v1.0.0**  

Without these, the Validator or FHA will reject the proof.

---

# 6. RWP and Poverty Context

DGCP ensures that:

- Low-quality photos  
- Low-end smartphones  
- Poor lighting  
- A lack of electricity  
- Harsh weather  
- Manual hardship  

**are never grounds for rejection.**

Poverty is not a technical failure.

Real work in extreme conditions is still real work.

---

# 7. FHA Interpretation Rules (Context Level)

FHA MUST interpret RWP based on:

- weather (cold mornings, rain, heat)  
- resource constraints (no electricity, limited tools)  
- cultural norms  
- physical capabilities of the worker  
- economic context  

Meaning ≠ Efficiency  
Meaning = Contribution within real constraints.
