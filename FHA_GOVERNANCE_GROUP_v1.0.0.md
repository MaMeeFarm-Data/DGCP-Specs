# 🦆 DGCP™ Federated Human Audit (FHA) Governance v1.0.0  
### Canonical Governance Rules for Human Truth Validation

The Federated Human Audit (FHA) is the human governance backbone of  
the DGCP™ protocol. While the Validator protects *integrity*,  
the FHA protects *truth, meaning, and fairness*.

This document establishes the rules, responsibilities, and ethical  
constitution of the FHA for v1.0.0.

---

# 1. Purpose of the FHA

The FHA exists to:

1. Protect the Human-Interpretive layer of the DGCP protocol  
2. Determine whether a proof reflects *Real Work*  
3. Provide contextual judgment where machines cannot  
4. Preserve labor dignity and prevent misuse of data  
5. Resolve disputes and ensure fairness across all workers  

The FHA is the guardian of **Labor Justice**, not technical correctness.

# 2. FHA Core Principles

FHA members must uphold:

1. **Human-First Decision Authority**  
   – Only humans interpret meaning.  
   – No AI/ML classification is allowed.

2. **Neutrality & Non-Discrimination**  
   – No bias based on age, gender, race, wealth, nationality.

3. **Transparency & Accountability**  
   – All decisions must be documented.  
   – Reasoning must be clear and reproducible.

4. **Privacy Protection**  
   – No attempt to identify workers beyond pseudonymous IDs.

5. **Append-Only Governance**  
   – Audits cannot erase or overwrite proofs.  
   – Corrections must be made through transparent add-ons.

6. **Open Federation**  
   – No single entity controls truth.  
   – Multiple independent groups can operate FHA nodes.

# 3. FHA Membership Structure

FHA governance follows a **federated model**:

- **Local FHA Groups:** Review proofs within a region or industry  
- **Regional FHA Councils:** Resolve escalations  
- **Global FHA Council:** Handles multi-region disputes and rule updates  

No group has unilateral power. All must follow protocol rules.

---

# 4. FHA Responsibilities

FHA members conduct:

## 4.1. Consistency Review  
They check:  
- Does the work_type match the media?  
- Does the description match the context?  
- Does the proof align with the worker’s environment and history?

## 4.2. Contextual Interpretation  
Examples:  
- Weather conditions  
- Seasonal agricultural patterns  
- Cultural work norms  
- Environmental or equipment use  

## 4.3. Truth Validation  
Determine whether the submitted proof meets DGCP’s definition of:  
**“Human-performed, meaningful labor.”**

## 4.4. Dispute Resolution  
FHA mediates disputes between:  
- Workers  
- Validators  
- Indexing layers  
- Auditors  
- Third-party verifiers

---

# 5. FHA Boundaries (Strict Prohibitions)

To protect workers:

The FHA MUST NEVER:

- Require personal identity from workers  
- Demand exact GPS location  
- Force workers to use certain apps or tools  
- Penalize low-quality photos  
- Use AI-based classification  
- Evaluate efficiency or productivity  
- Compare workers against each other  

DGCP is **not** a worker surveillance tool.

# 6. FHA Workflow: Step-by-Step

1. Validator completes Machine-Critical checks  
2. Metadata enters “Pending Human Audit Queue”  
3. FHA reviews context fields:  
   - short_human_description  
   - tags  
   - location_label  
   - work_type  
   - ipfs_cid_primary media  
4. FHA votes: PASS / NEEDS REVIEW / FLAG  
5. Decision recorded immutably in GitHub registry  
6. If flagged → escalated to Regional FHA  
7. All decisions remain append-only

---

# 7. Governance Decisions

Governance decisions are:

- Public  
- Documented  
- Immutable (append-only)  
- Rationalized with reference to Human-First Principles  
- NEVER made by machines  

---

# 8. Required Skills for FHA Members

Members must have:

- Contextual knowledge of the industry or region  
- Understanding of DGCP ethics  
- Ability to interpret human descriptions  
- Sensitivity to cultural and economic differences  
- Commitment to fairness and privacy  

No technical background required.

---

# 9. Training & Certification

DGCP requires FHA members to undergo:

- Human-First Ethics Training  
- Anti-Bias and Fairness Training  
- Protocol Familiarization  
- Case Review Practice  
- Annual reassessment  

All training modules are open-source and globally accessible.

---

# 10. Accountability Mechanisms

To prevent abuse:

- All audit decisions are public  
- Members with repeated bias patterns face removal  
- Workers can appeal decisions  
- Regional and global councils provide oversight  
- Auditor identities are logged pseudonymously  

Bias is treated as a protocol violation.

---

# 11. Global Federation Rules

- Any country or NGO can host FHA nodes  
- No single nation can dominate governance  
- No military, intelligence, or corporate body may control decisions  
- FHA governance is built on **neutrality and decentralization**  

---

# 12. Versioning & Upgrades

- v1.0.0 defines the foundational FHA rules  
- Minor upgrades (v1.1.x) may extend workflows  
- Major upgrades (v2.0.0) require global FHA vote  
- Human-First, Privacy, and Anti-Surveillance rules can never be weakened
