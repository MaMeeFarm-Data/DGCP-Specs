## 1. Purpose of this License

The MMFARM-POL-2025 License governs all Real-Work Data (RWD), Proof-of-Life (PoL),  
and Proof-of-Labor (POL) generated by MaMeeFarm™ under the DGCP™ protocol.

This license ensures:

- **Human ownership first**  
- **No data extraction by AI/companies without attribution**
- **Permanent transparency of provenance**
- **Non-commercial restrictions unless licensed directly by the worker**
- **Traceable lineage through IPFS → GitHub SHA256 → Minimal DLT Timestamp**

This license is intentionally designed for low-income labor environments,  
where human-origin data must remain protected against institutional capture.

---

## 2. Ownership of Real-Work Data (RWD)

1. All Real-Work Data is created by a **human worker**, not by a device or algorithm.  
2. The original worker (signing key: `worker_id_public`) retains:
   - Full upstream ownership  
   - Rights to attribution  
   - Rights to revoke commercial usage  
   - Rights to license or sell their RWD independently  

3. No company, cloud provider, AI model, platform, or organization may claim  
   upstream ownership or exclusive rights over RWD.

---

## 3. Permitted Uses

Users MAY:

- View, study, analyze, and audit the data.  
- Use the data for **non-commercial research**, provided attribution is maintained:  
  “Data provided under MMFARM-POL-2025 License by MaMeeFarm™ (Mueang Pan, Thailand).”

- Use RWD to:
  - Improve ethical AI
  - Study human labor conditions
  - Build transparent public systems
  - Conduct educational work

---

## 4. Restricted / Prohibited Uses

The following uses are **strictly prohibited without an explicit written license**  
from the original worker or MaMeeFarm™:

1. **Commercial reuse** of any kind  
2. **AI training or model fine-tuning** without attribution and non-commercial compliance  
3. **Surveillance, monitoring, or worker profiling**  
4. **Governmental or corporate extraction of labor patterns**  
5. **Derivatives that remove the worker’s identity or origin**  
6. **Embedding the data into proprietary datasets or closed systems**

Any violation voids the user’s rights to access the dataset.

---

## 5. Integrity Requirements

Any use of the dataset MUST preserve:

- The original **IPFS CID**  
- The original **git_commit_sha256**  
- The **DMS metadata object**  
- The **timestamp proof (OTS/Bitcoin)**  
- The worker’s short human description  
- All licensing headers in the metadata files  

These properties guarantee human-origin tracing and prevent synthetic tampering.

## 6. Attribution Requirement (Mandatory)

All uses (non-commercial only) MUST include:
