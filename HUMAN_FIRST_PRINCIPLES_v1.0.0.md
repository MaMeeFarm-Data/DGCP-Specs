# 🦆 DGCP™ Human-First Principles v1.0.0  
### Canonical Ethical Foundation for Real-Work Proof (RWD)

This document defines the non-negotiable ethical principles of the  
DGCP™ protocol. These principles guarantee that DGCP remains a  
**Human-First, Worker-Safe, Privacy-Preserving** global system for  
real-work verification across all industries and countries.

These principles are not technical guidelines—they are **constitutional  
rules** that govern the entire DGCP ecosystem.

---

## 1. DGCP Is a Human-Proof Protocol, Not a Data-Collection System

DGCP validates **human labor**, not machine telemetry.

This means:  
- Proof must originate from a human action  
- Metadata must be signed by a human-controlled key  
- Descriptions must be written in human language  
- IoT, sensors, and machine-generated streams are explicitly excluded  

DGCP is designed to empower workers, not replace them.

---

## 2. Machine Validation Must Never Override Human Interpretation

To protect human context and avoid algorithmic bias:

- The DGCP Validator checks only **Machine-Critical** fields  
- It must never evaluate meaning, truth, or intent  
- No ML/AI classification or “scoring” is allowed  
- Human Audit Groups retain absolute governance over content validity  

**Meaning Ensures Truth, not machine scoring.**

## 3. Zero Surveillance, Zero Exploitation

DGCP forbids any form of:

- real-time monitoring  
- biometric capture  
- GPS-level location  
- automated behavioral tracking  
- corporate-owned IoT surveillance  

Workers must control what they submit and when.

---

## 4. Proof Must Be Pseudonymous by Default

Workers must not expose personal identity in DGCP.

DGCP enforces:

- Public keys instead of names  
- Location labels instead of GPS  
- No demographic data  
- No facial recognition  
- No personal identifiers  

Pseudonymity protects vulnerable workers across borders.

---

## 5. Proof Must Be Accessible and Low-Cost

DGCP must never require expensive tools.

Workers must be able to submit proofs using:

- A low-end phone  
- Low bandwidth Internet  
- Public Wi-Fi  
- Free GitHub repositories  
- Zero-cost IPFS pinning when possible  

The system must remain accessible even for the poorest workers.

---

## 6. Append-Only History Is Mandatory

Truth must be traceable.

Therefore:

- Proofs cannot be edited or deleted  
- No forced GitHub pushes  
- No rebasing or history rewriting  
- Corrections must be append-only  

Transparency protects workers from manipulation.

---

## 7. No Corporate or Government Overreach

DGCP’s governance forbids:

- Corporate interpretation of labor  
- Government surveillance integration  
- AI-based worker evaluation systems  
- Infrastructure that allows centralized power to “score” or “control” workers  

DGCP protects labor from both state and corporate abuse.

---

## 8. Ethical AI Usage

AI may assist with:

- indexing public proofs  
- search and transparency  
- metadata formatting help  

AI must never:

- judge the quality of labor  
- classify the legitimacy of a proof  
- replace human auditors  
- make governance decisions  

AI supports DGCP; it never governs it.

---

## 9. Worker Autonomy Is Sacred

Workers may choose:

- what to submit  
- when to submit  
- how detailed their description is  
- what tags to include  
- whether to add additional media  

DGCP cannot coerce submissions.

---

## 10. Long-Term Stability and Neutrality

Human-first principles cannot be weakened or removed in future versions.

Future updates may:

- add optional features  
- improve tools  
- expand indexing  

Future updates may **never**:

- remove privacy protections  
- add surveillance tools  
- enable machine-approved proof  
- raise economic barriers  

These principles form the constitutional core of DGCP™.
