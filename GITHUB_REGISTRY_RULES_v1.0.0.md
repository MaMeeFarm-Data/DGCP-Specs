# 🦆 DGCP™ GitHub Registry Rules v1.0.0  
### Canonical Governance for Append-Only Real-Work Proof (RWD)

This document defines the official rules for using GitHub as the  
**DGCP Global Proof Registry (GPR)**. These rules guarantee that  
Real-Work Proofs remain transparent, immutable, auditable, and safe  
for workers across all jurisdictions.

GitHub is not used as a “developer platform” but as a **public,  
append-only, time-ordered truth ledger** anchored by SHA256 integrity.

---

## 1. Purpose of the GitHub Registry

GitHub provides:

- An append-only, chronological history of all Proof submissions  
- Immutable commit hashes (SHA256)  
- Public visibility for auditors, researchers, and institutions  
- Zero hosting cost for low-income workers  
- A strong global uptime guarantee  

GitHub is chosen **not as a Web2 service**, but as a  
**public cryptographic ledger** aligned with human-first values.

---

## 2. Fundamental Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These are the core requirements that must never be violated.

### ✔ 2.1. Proof entries MUST be append-only  
A Proof file **must never be altered**, only added in chronological order.

### ✔ 2.2. No deletion of historical Proofs  
Even if a file contains a mistake, it remains part of the chain.  
Corrections must be made by adding new commits, not rewriting history.

### ✔ 2.3. No commit history rewriting  
Forbidden actions:  
- `git push --force`  
- Rebase after publication  
- History squashing  

These actions destroy provenance and violate the protocol.

### ✔ 2.4. Every commit MUST contain at least one verifiable Proof artifact  
A commit without a valid proof file is not allowed.

### ✔ 2.5. Timestamps are essential  
The `timestamp_utc` in the DMS + the GitHub commit timestamp must align  
to show the chronological order of real-world labor.

---

## 3. Directory Structure Requirements

A DGCP Proof Registry must follow:
/proofs/YYYY/MM/DD/proof_<proof_id>.json
/verifications/ # optional human-audit notes
/ots/ # minimal DLT timestamp files
/indices/ # optional public indexing clients

### Why structured by date?  
Because human-origin data must reflect real labor flow, not batch uploads or machine streams.

---

## 4. Commit Requirements

Each commit must include:

| Item | Requirement | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Proof File (.json) | MUST follow DMS v1.0.0 | Machine verifiable |
| Commit Message | MUST follow DGCP commit format | Audit clarity |
| Extended Description | SHOULD include human context | Research utility |
| File Path | MUST match date hierarchy | Chronology |
| SHA256 | Auto-generated by GitHub | Immutable anchor |

**Commit messages are part of governance**, not optional decoration.

---

## 5. Commit Message Format (Standard)

### Required Format:
feat: add proof <proof_id> - <short descriptor>

### Examples:
feat: add proof 032 - morning duck check
feat: add proof 041 - water pump maintenance
feat: add proof 050 - banana grove care

---

## 6. Extended Description Rules

Each Proof commit SHOULD include:

- Human-readable detail  
- Work context (weather, season, condition)  
- Ethical note (e.g., no IoT data, no surveillance)  
- Stable location label  
- Verification notes (if available)  

These descriptions help future researchers understand labor conditions.

---

## 7. Handling Mistakes (Corrections)

If a worker uploads incorrect metadata:

### Never edit the original file.

Correct action:
1. Add a new file with fixed metadata  
2. Reference the previous erroneous proof  
3. Add a human note in `/verifications/` directory if needed  

This preserves transparency and builds trust.

---

## 8. Why GitHub Works for DGCP

GitHub provides:

### ✔ Global replication  
Millions of mirrors & distributed caching

### ✔ Immutable commit history  
SHA256 + Merkle Tree = tamper-evident

### ✔ Public transparency  
No private servers required

### ✔ Free access for low-income workers  
No subscription barriers

### ✔ Interoperability  
DLT timestamps can anchor the root hash for global immutability

GitHub effectively becomes a **Public Good Ledger** without requiring blockchain complexity.

---

## 9. DLT Anchor Requirement

For long-term, cross-border auditability:  
The repository’s root commit SHA256 must be anchored using:

- OpenTimestamps (Bitcoin)  
- Or a minimal Bitcoin/L2 timestamp transaction  

This ensures that even if GitHub disappears, the Proof Chain remains valid.

---

## 10. Forward Compatibility

These rules must remain stable for 10+ years.

Future versions may only add:
- Optional folders  
- Optional indexing layers  
- Additional documentation  

They may never remove or weaken:
- Append-only  
- No deletion  
- No rewriting  
- SHA256-based provenance
